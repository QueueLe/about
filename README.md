# Hello World!

I'm Quang "Juan". I've been developing interactive web application for over 20 years using various programming languages. It is very rewarding to see my work having a positive impact to the end users. One of my projects from 10 years ago is still accessed everyday by the original content creators to showcase their works to potential employers and funders.
